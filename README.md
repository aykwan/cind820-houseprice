# cind820-houseprice

Welcome all to my capstone project for CIND820: Big Data Analytics Project for Fall 2020 at Ryerson University.

This is an attempt to model a regression for the prediction of housing prices. The dataset was provided courtesy of Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques

The finalized version is v1.4 which includes the original R notebook (.rmd) and the HTML file of it.

The model produced here was:
-Linear regression
-Lasso Regression
